Hello Geeks! How are you all? Hope! you'll good.

In this particular we are developing a decision review system using Python3 Language and various module to work on.

**Important Note :
    [*] You have to include a video named "clip.mp4" in the repository for observing.
    [*] Install following Modules using pip from your command line utility.
        a) pip install cv2
        b) pip install pillow
        c) pip install imutils
    

Now, we will discuss about some important modules we used in this project to make it work.
1. tkinter module used for creating a GUI for the app.
2. cv2 module is used to read images and video files from the local directory to format them to import in app.
3. PIL module is the Python Imaging Library.
4. imutils module is used for resizing of the frame of the video according to the canvas of the app.
5. Threading is used for running the App and the video frames in parallel so that error occured can not effect the app.
